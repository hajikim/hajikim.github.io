#### CJ the X: [Taste] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPrNWuppMcc&t=2251s&ab_channel=CJTheX) 
< "Nobody thinks that Mcdonald's is the height of taste, despite the fact that everyone kind of likes it and it's everywhere. It's popularity is almost indicative of its inferior quality. Just liking the easy thing to like that everyone else likes is the opposite of taste. Taste is about being select and specific not general and inoffensive. Taste."

## Technique

➼ **Legato** needs to be done in the left hand as well. Set up your hand position so that you don't need to move anything but the fingertip for the next note. Perhaps even the next two notes? Use your own discretion. 


## The KEY

✽ the key to BC is bow control

✽ the key to JS is creativity and slow practice

✽ the key to SS is smiling

✽ the key to HK is worship and creativity

## On Performance

✽ The completion of a piece is when the audience hears it. 

✽ The marriage between audibility and colors and intimacy. 

### IT

**@zannimask:** (https://www.tiktok.com/@zannimask/video/7138097419769728262?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7139663859371312646)

"Maybe that's the "it" thing that everyone's always talking about. "She has *it*, he has *it*..." 

What is that "it" thing? It's the love. Because the love is everything. 


That's what it is for me. Just a love of doing it, because if you love doing it, it's gonna really show, even if the moves aren't necessarily happy-go-lucky. The love shines through and the love is what gets people to play with it. And playing with art is how you get creative. 

### **Bohemian Rhapsody movie:**

Mary Austin: What's it like, singing for all those people?

Freddie Mercury: When I know they're listening, when I know I really have them, I couldn't sing off-key if I tried. I am exactly the person I was always meant to be. I'm not afraid of anything.

First things first, if you feel like you have to show emotion and you're aware of it, your brain's not focusing on the right thing. If I'm working with an engine and aligns with the orchestration and characterisation, what comes through my voice is always enough emotionality. It's all in my lungs, and all in my heart and I'm just channeling what that engine is sending me through my voice. You need to be using the right engine.

## Chamber music

✽ You must know your role in the music, and know what the others' roles are as well. 
ie. Who has the main melody and who is the rhythm section. 

✽ practice excerpts for auditions by playing them with your friends and recordings to understand ^ 

# Favs of 2022

a. *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) dir. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert

	☻ Soundtrack
	
	☻ title sequences (ex. PART 1: EVERYTHING) visually and auditorily overwhelming and stunning 
	
	☻ Organic humor 
	
	☻ Jobu Tupaki's costumes
	
	☻ Experimental, creative, and heartfelt. 
	

b. *Dune* (2021) dir. Denis Villeneuve

	☻ Insect themed conceptual vehicles 
	
	☻ Visually immersive and auditorily stunning. 
	
	☻ Soundtrack fits the mood perfectly. *Gom Jabbar* is chef's kiss. 
	
	- second act too slow
	
	

c. *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) dir. Joseph Kosinski.

	☻ A real appreciation for "real"ness, in a world saturated with CGI and camera tricks, thanks to Tom Cruise's love of stunts. 
	
	☻ A perfect, golden model for a "standard" action movie. 
	
	☻ Thrilling, heartfelt, and a healthy dose of 'Murica. 
	
	☻ "Top Gun Anthem" by Harold Faltermeyer & Steve Stevens may be my favorite theme ever. 
	
	☻ Anthem + title card entrances, give the editor a raise. 
	

d. *Call Me By Your Name* (2017) dir. Luca Guadagnino

	☻ Aesthetically, this is everything. I would like to be Somewhere in Northern Italy at all times. 
	
	☻ Title sequence is beautiful. 
	
	☻ Lighting, color palette, fonts, soundtrack, setting, landscape, fits perfectly.
	
	☻ Hallelujah Junction by John Adams 
	
	- I have many problems with the story 
	
	- Oliver is manipulative and predatory 
	
	- This would have made much more [sense](https://markolmsted.medium.com/whats-wrong-with-call-me-by-my-name-and-how-it-could-have-been-fixed-2b2003c1b3fc)
