#### CJ the X: [Taste] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPrNWuppMcc&t=2251s&ab_channel=CJTheX) 
< "Nobody thinks that Mcdonald's is the height of taste, despite the fact that everyone kind of likes it and it's everywhere. It's popularity is almost indicative of its inferior quality. Just liking the easy thing to like that everyone else likes is the opposite of taste. Taste is about being select and specific not general and inoffensive. Taste."

## Technique

➼ **Legato** needs to be done in the left hand as well. Set up your hand position so that you don't need to move anything but the fingertip for the next note. Perhaps even the next two notes? Use your own discretion. 


## The KEY

✽ the key to BC is bow control

✽ the key to JS is creativity and slow practice

✽ the key to SS is smiling

## Performance

✽ The completion of a piece is when the audience hears it. 

✽ The marriage between audibility and colors and intimacy. 

## Chamber music

✽ You must know your role in the music, and know what the others' roles are as well. 
ie. Who has the main melody and who is the rhythm section. 

✽ practice excerpts for auditions by playing them with your friends and recordings to understand ^ 

# Favs of 2022

a. *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022) dir. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert

	☻ Soundtrack
	
	☻ title sequences (ex. PART 1: EVERYTHING) visually and auditorily overwhelming and stunning 
	
	☻ Organic humor 
	
	☻ Jobu Tupaki's costumes
	
	☻ Experimental, creative, and heartfelt. 
	

b. *Dune* (2021) dir. Denis Villeneuve

	☻ Insect themed conceptual vehicles 
	
	☻ Visually immersive and auditorily stunning. 
	
	☻ Soundtrack fits the mood perfectly. *Gom Jabbar* is chef's kiss. 
	
	- second act too slow
	
	

c. *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) dir. Joseph Kosinski.

	☻ A real appreciation for "real"ness, in a world saturated with CGI and camera tricks, thanks to Tom Cruise's love of stunts. 
	
	☻ A perfect, golden model for a "standard" action movie. 
	
	☻ Thrilling, heartfelt, and a healthy dose of 'Murica. 
	
	☻ "Top Gun Anthem" by Harold Faltermeyer & Steve Stevens may be my favorite theme ever. 
	
	☻ Anthem + title card entrances, give the editor a raise. 
	

d. *Call Me By Your Name* (2017) dir. Luca Guadagnino

	☻ Aesthetically, this is everything. I would like to be Somewhere in Northern Italy at all times. 
	
	☻ Title sequence is beautiful. 
	
	☻ Lighting, color palette, fonts, soundtrack, setting, landscape, fits perfectly.
	
	☻ Hallelujah Junction by John Adams 
	
	- I have many problems with the story 
	
	- Oliver is manipulative and predatory 
	
	- This would have made much more [sense](https://markolmsted.medium.com/whats-wrong-with-call-me-by-my-name-and-how-it-could-have-been-fixed-2b2003c1b3fc)
